# data/

This folder contains the dataset used for training, evaluating, and running inference with the Git Commit Message Generator models.

---

## Contents

The main file expected in this folder is:

### `cleaned_python_commit_dataset.csv`

A CSV file with two columns:

- `commit_message`: The original commit message written by a human.
- `diff`: The corresponding Git diff (code changes).

This dataset was curated to include only commits that:
- Modify Python files (`.py`) exclusively
- Have commit messages between 50â€“300 characters
- Avoid merge commits, metadata, or noisy logs (cleaned out)

---
