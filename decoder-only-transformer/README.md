# Git Commit Message Generator

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to generate Git commit messages from code diffs using a decoder-only transformer (GPT-2 architecture). The model is trained from scratch on high-quality Python-only commits from open-source repositories. It learns to map code changes (diffs) to natural language commit messages using a custom BPE tokenizer and a GPT-2 model configured with 125M parameters.

---

## 🧠 Model Summary

- **Architecture**: GPT-2 style transformer (decoder-only)
- **Tokenizer**: Custom Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer trained on the dataset
- **Input**: Git diff
- **Output**: Autoregressively generated commit message
- **Training Objective**: Language modeling with start, diff delimiter, and end tokens

## Notebook Breakdown

### `Training-Git-Commit-Transformer.ipynb`
- Trains a BPE tokenizer using the cleaned dataset.
- Builds and trains a GPT-2 model from scratch:
  - 20 layers, 768 hidden size, 12 attention heads, 1024 context window
- Saves weights to `trained_model/model.safetensors`.

### `Inference-for-Git-Commit-Transformer.ipynb`
- Loads tokenizer and trained model.
- Uses `generate_commit_message()` to produce predictions from new diffs.
- Supports inference on both custom and validation samples.

### `Performance_Evaluation_for_Git_Commit_Transformer.ipynb`
- Runs generation and scoring for 100 random samples from the dataset.
- Computes:
  - BLEU-4
  - ROUGE-L
  - METEOR
  - BERTScore
  - RAGAs Answer Correctness (LLM-based)
- Saves results in both JSON and visual formats (PNG plots, text outputs).

## OpenAI Key Required for RAGAs

> **To evaluate Answer Correctness (RAGAs)**:
>
> - You must set your OpenAI API key:
>   ```python
>   os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."  # Paid key required
>   ```
> - RAGAs uses GPT-3.5/GPT-4 under the hood and **requires credits**.

## Tokenizer Details

- Stored in `custom_bpe_tokenizer.json`
- Vocabulary size: 48,000 tokens
- Trained on both commit messages and diffs
- Uses GPT-2 compatible byte-level pre-tokenization

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric           | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **BLEU-4**        | Measures n-gram overlap                     |
| **ROUGE-L**       | Longest common subsequence recall           |
| **METEOR**        | Semantic alignment with synonyms            |
| **BERTScore**     | Embedding-based similarity                  |
| **RAGAs**         | GPT-graded factual alignment (LLM-based)    |

This decoder-only transformer serves as the **flagship model** in this project and **outperforms a GRU-based baseline** on both syntactic and semantic metrics. It is a fully custom pipeline, from tokenizer to evaluation, designed for the task of code-to-natural language generation.
